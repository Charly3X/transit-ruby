transit-ruby
===================

Transit is a format and set of libraries for conveying values between
applications written in different programming languages. See
[https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-format)
for details.

transit-ruby is a Transit encoder/decoder library for Ruby.

```ruby
# io can be any Ruby IO

writer = Transit::Writer.new(:json, io) # or :json-verbose, :msgpack
writer.write(value)

reader = Transit::Reader.new(:json, io) # or :msgpack
reader.read

# or

reader.read {|val| do_something_with(val)}
```

For example:

```
irb(2.1.1): io = StringIO.new('', 'w+')
==========> #<StringIO:0x007faab2ec3970>
irb(2.1.1): writer = Transit::Writer.new(:json, io)
==========> #<Transit::Writer:0x007faab2e8c1c8 @marshaler=#<Transit::JsonMarshaler:0x007faab2e1a168..........(snip)..........
irb(2.1.1): writer.write("abc")
==========> nil
irb(2.1.1): writer.write(123456789012345678901234567890)
==========> nil
irb(2.1.1): io.string
==========> "{\"~#'\":\"abc\"}\n{\"~#'\":\"~n123456789012345678901234567890\"}\n"
irb(2.1.1): reader = Transit::Reader.new(:json, StringIO.new(io.string))
==========> #<Transit::Reader:0x007faab2db48e0 @reader=#<Transit::JsonUnmarshaler:0x007faab2dae030 @..........(snip)..........
irb(2.1.1): reader.read {|val| puts val}
abc
123456789012345678901234567890
```

# Typed arrays

The transit spec defines typed arrays (ints, longs, doubles, floats,
and bools). Since these are not supported in the Ruby language, when a
Transit::Reader encounters a typed array (<code>{"ints" =>
[1,2,3]}</code>) it delivers just the array to the app
(<code>[1,2,3]</code>).

If, however, your app would benefit from writing an array of ints
(e.g. another process uses a language like Java, which does support arrays
of primitve types), you can write them out as TaggedValues:

```ruby
TaggedValue.new("ints", [1,2,3])
```

# Supported Rubies

* MRI 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2

# Development

## Setup

Transit Ruby uses transit as a submodule to get at the transit
exemplar files. The tests will not run without the exemplar files.
You need to run a couple of git commands to set up the transit
git submodule:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## Benchmarks

```sh
./bin/seattle-benchmark
```

## Running the examples

```sh
bundle exec rake spec
```

## Build

```sh
bundle exec rake build

# or, if you want to install the gem locally ...

bundle exec rake build
```

The version number is automatically incremented based on the number of commits.
The command below shows what version number will be applied.

```sh
build/revision
```

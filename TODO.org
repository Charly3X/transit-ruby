* 1.8.7-ify
** problems to solve
- no SecureRandom.uuid - need to find (or build) alternate solution
  - or not support generation - just wrapping
- :array and :map keys in Handler need to be Strings or need to to_s
  tags
- date formats are all different, need to re-implement for 1.8
- caching is broken (not sure why yet)
- escaping is broken (not sure why yet)
* jruby
- can't use oj or msgpack-ruby, which both use C extensions
* rbx ???
* check stringable_keys?
does it handle the diffs between msgpack and json?
* move most of writer_spec to marshaler_spec
* consider two read formats
- ruby
  - reads stringlike things as strings
  - reads typed arrays as arrays
- transit
  - reads stinglike things as Ruby and Transit-specific types
    - e.g. URI | Addressable::URI
  - wraps typed arrays

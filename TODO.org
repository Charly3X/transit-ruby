* means of registering handlers
* Deal with reading unrecognized extensions; these are *not* errors.
- For a string, reader should return (str "`" encoded-str)
- For a map, reader should return an instance of a TaggedValue type w/
map's tag and value
- Writer should remove ` from strs that start w/ `~
- Writer should encode TaggedValue as having tag and value it carries
inside it
- This allows a reader to receive non-decoded data and write it back out
w/o losing any information
- This is the default behavior for readers/writers - but there must be a
way for a client to configure a reader to do something else, e.g.,
throw an exception
* 1.8.7-ify
** problems to solve
- no SecureRandom.uuid - need to find (or build) alternate solution
  - or not support generation - just wrapping
- :array and :map keys in Handler need to be Strings or need to to_s
  tags
- date formats are all different, need to re-implement for 1.8
- caching is broken (not sure why yet)
- escaping is broken (not sure why yet)
* require msgpack or oj on demand (don't load the ones we don't need)
